# :monocle_face: About
This project was developed in order to practice ReactJS features in the format of a mobile application. The development happened together, using agile methods.

A recipe API was consumed to develop the application.
You can search for recipes by name, first letter or ingredient.
You can also add a recipe to favorites so that it is saved in the Local Storage.
